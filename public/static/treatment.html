        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Dr. Johanna Budwig, a German physician and seven-time alternative Nobel Prize nominee, created what is now
            called the "Budwig Protocol" as a way to cure cancer. It mainly consists of a three-month flax oil-quark
            program, which is a combination diet of whole flaxseeds, flaxseed oil, and low-fat organic cottage cheese
            (known in Europe as "quark").
            The Budwig diet includes a long list of other recommended foods such as herbs, nuts, cocoa, and tea. She
            also provided a list of foods to stay away from, which include hydrogenated oils, hard-shell seafood, white
            breads, and soy products.
            The Budwig program replenishes cells that are devoid of essential fats and oils, thereby allowing them to
            function once again. In turn, this leads to healing and recovery from a number of degenerative diseases
            including cancer.
            Dr. Budwig held that cancer was caused by one of four things: a weak immune system, toxins, an improper
            diet, or oxygen deprivation (or a combination of any of these things).</p>
